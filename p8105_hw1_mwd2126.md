\#Problem 1

First, ensure you have the “palmerpenguins” package installed. Then, we
will load the `penguins` dataset:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The `penguins` dataset describes a sample of penguins and includes
information on species, island, various body measurements (including
bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass), sex, and year.
The dataset contains 344 rows and 8 columns.
