This is an R Markdown document for Homework 1 of course P8105.

# Problem 1

First, ensure you have the “palmerpenguins” package installed. Then,
we’ll load the `penguins` dataset:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The `penguins` dataset describes a sample of penguins and includes
information on species, island, various body measurements (including
bill length (mm), bill depth (mm), flipper length (mm), and body
mass(g)), sex, and year. The dataset contains 344 rows and 8 columns.
The mean flipper length is 200.9 mm.

Next, we’ll look at a scatter plot of flipper length vs bill length.
First, we’ll drop rows with missing data and then build our plot.

``` r
penguins %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(flipper_length_mm, bill_length_mm, color=species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("Flipper Length vs. Bill Length") + 
  xlab("Flipper Length (mm)") + 
  ylab("Bill Length (mm)") +
  scale_colour_discrete("Species")
```

Then, we’ll export this scatter plot to our project directory.

``` r
ggsave("penguin_plot.jpg")
```

# Problem 2

We’ll create a data frame comprised of:

- a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
- a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
  than 0
- a character vector of length 10
- a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
df = 
  tibble(
    a = rnorm(10),
    b = a > 0,
    c = character(10),
    d = factor(c("small", "small", "small", "medium", "medium", "medium", "medium", "large", "large", "large"))
)
```

Now, we’ll try taking the mean of each vector and see what happens.

``` r
mean(pull(df, a))
```

    ## [1] 0.1357851

``` r
mean(pull(df, b))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(pull(df, c))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, c)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(df, d))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, d)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

We can take the means of `a` and `b` because the former is a vector of
integers and the latter is a vector of 1s and 0s, which are interpreted
as TRUE and FALSE statements, respectively. However, we can’t take the
means of the character and factor vectors! Maybe we can try converting
some of these variables to see if that solves the problem.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df, a))
as.numeric(pull(df, c))
as.numeric(pull(df, d))
```

This helps us take the mean for `d` (because the factors are converted
to numerical values based on their alphabetical order) but not `c`
(because the character vector cannot be directly converted into a
numeric vector).

That’s a wrap on Homework 1.
