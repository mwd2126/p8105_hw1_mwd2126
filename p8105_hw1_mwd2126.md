This is an R Markdown document for Homework 1 of course P8105.

# Problem 1

First, ensure you have the “palmerpenguins” package installed. Then,
we’ll load the `penguins` dataset:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The `penguins` dataset describes a sample of penguins and includes
information on species, island, various body measurements (including
bill length (mm), bill depth (mm), flipper length (mm), and body mass),
sex, and year. The dataset contains 344 rows and 8 columns. The mean
flipper length is 200.9 mm.

Next, we’ll look at a scatter plot of flipper length vs bill length.
First, we’ll drop rows with missing data and then build our plot.

``` r
penguins %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(flipper_length_mm, bill_length_mm, color=species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("Flipper Length vs. Bill Length") + 
  xlab("Flipper Length (mm)") + 
  ylab("Bill Length (mm)") +
  scale_colour_discrete("Species")
```

Then, we’ll export this scatter plot to our project directory.

``` r
ggsave("penguin_plot.jpg")
```
