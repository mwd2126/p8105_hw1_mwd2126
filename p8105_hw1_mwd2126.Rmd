This is an R Markdown document for Homework 1 of course P8105.

#Problem 1

First, ensure you have the "palmerpenguins" package installed. Then, we will load the `penguins` dataset:

```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The `penguins` dataset describes a sample of penguins and includes information on species, island, various body measurements (including bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass), sex, and year. The dataset contains `r nrow(penguins)` rows and `r ncol(penguins)` columns.
