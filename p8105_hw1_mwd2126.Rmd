This is an R Markdown document for Homework 1 of course P8105.

# Problem 1

First, ensure you have the "palmerpenguins" package installed. Then, we'll load the `penguins` dataset:

```{r load data}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The `penguins` dataset describes a sample of penguins and includes information on species, island, various body measurements (including bill length (mm), bill depth (mm), flipper length (mm), and body mass), sex, and year. The dataset contains `r nrow(penguins)` rows and `r ncol(penguins)` columns. The mean flipper length is `r mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE) %>% round(1)` mm.

Next, we'll look at a scatter plot of flipper length vs bill length. First, we'll drop rows with missing data and then build our plot. 

```{r build the plot}
penguins %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(flipper_length_mm, bill_length_mm, color=species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("Flipper Length vs. Bill Length") + 
  xlab("Flipper Length (mm)") + 
  ylab("Bill Length (mm)") +
  scale_colour_discrete("Species")
 
```

Then, we'll export this scatter plot to our project directory.

```{r save the plot}
ggsave("penguin_plot.jpg")
```
